This font is based on a sample of 'dainty' Chancery writing, most probably published in 1716, and most probably written by the German writing master Michael Baurenfeind.

Apart from the long s on the number sign, you'll find some alternate characters, and lots of swashes in this font. Those are: 

- a complicated underline swash on the underscore 
- a more simple underline swash on the bar and broken bar sign 
- an alternate s on the 'less than' sign. This is the original s from the template (I didn't like it). 
- an alternate r on the 'greater than' sign 
- a swashed l on the left bracket 
- a swashed h on the right bracket 
- a swashed b on the long s sign 
- a swash on the left curly bracket (to be used like an accent) 
- a swash on the right curly bracket (to be used like an accent) 
- a swash on the ASCII tilde (to be used like an accent).

The ornament on the micro sign has been inspired by a detail from a 17th century book on fountain architecture.
