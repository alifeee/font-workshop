# Using personal fonts

To use a personal font:

## On your own website or HTML page

Create a CSS class...

```CSS
@font-face {
    font-family: "BogFace";
    src: url("./bogface/BogFace.woff") format("woff");
}
.font--bogface {
    font-family: "BogFace", sans-serif;
}
```

and use it on anything you want styled with that font! Like this

```html
<span class="font--bogface">simple BogFace!</span> 
```

## On your computer

Install the font file and then you can use it in anything that uses fonts (Notepad, MS Word, Paint, Photoshop, etc.)

## On your browser

Install the font file and change your default font to your font in the browser settings.

## Physically

Laser cut something and you can use your font! Change the "text" to a "path" in your vector graphics software so that the laser cutter does not need to have your font installed.
